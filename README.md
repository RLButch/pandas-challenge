Code created using tutorial sessions, class activities and stack overflow

during an Ask BSC session it was discovered that my pycity code file didn't upload correctly into github - the code wouldn't run for the tutor but it was running on my computer, I'm not sure why this is but i've included some screenshots but will need some additional help if it doesn't upload properly for assessment. I would hate not to get marked when I know the code is working!!
